● Implement uploading the images

○ Create an api that accepts the image in the form body and upload the image to any cloud service such as s3.

○ You should not accept anything other than the images and the format of the images should be png/jpeg.

○ You shouldn't upload more than 2mb(You can either throw an error or reduce the size and upload a bonus point if you can do this).

● Create the document in the database(MongoDb)

○ After the images have been uploaded you need to store the url in the Image collection along with the uploadedDate.

● Implement Sorting, filtering and pagination

○ Create an endpoint /images that return the images

○ Pagination

■ Use 'page numbers' style of pagination

■ Include total count in the response matching the current query result

○ Sorting

■ allow sorting by uploadedDate

○ Filtering

■ Allow filtering by the uploadedDate

■ Should return the images from a specific date range (example: if user applies filter from 25th Jan to 29th Jan he should get all the images uploaded in that time period)
